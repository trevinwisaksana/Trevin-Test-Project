## Features
• Ability to search movies and display its posters

• Show the details of the movie e.g. description, year of release etc.

• Pagination by querrying data per page

• Zoom in and out of the movie poster's image view

• Detect if there is network connectivity before sending a network request

## Dependencies
• Alamofire

• SwiftyJSON

• Kingfisher

## Usage
To run this application, please install its dependcies using Cocoapods by running `pod install` using terminal on its directory. If there are any issues, please feel free to contact me.

## Areas of Improvements
If given more time, I would create a more sophisticated pagination mechanism to assure that it would fetch one at a time. Additionally, I would also display more information about each movie on the MovieDetailViewController.
